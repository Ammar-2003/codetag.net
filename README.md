# codetag.net

Codetag.net is my first serious project — an open-source blog website built to share what I've learned in programming. While I primarily focus on backend development, I also enjoy crafting clean user interfaces and somehow manage to get it done! I’ve tried my best to organize the code professionally. Feedback is always welcome — I’m open to tips and suggestions to keep improving!
